### Goals of this repo is to:

1. Make my own react bootstrap project with all dependencies
2. Store my custom components here
3. Understand better React and "around" Reacy system
4. Make development and bootstraping faster

### The project will grasp following concepts:

- React application architecture (components and composability over inheritance)
- Application State and it's architecture including actions, reducers etc
- Routing
- Client side middleware
- "API only" approach
- JWT authentification
- Layouting with the help of some of well known css frameworks
- Lifecycle, on demand component loading etc
- PWA
- TDD, helpfully with proper state setup
